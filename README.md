# Magnetic-Phase
Simulates the spins of a crystal latice as temperature changes.  
It uses the the Ising model, thus spins can eithe be up (1) or down (-1).  
It uses the Monte Carlo Simulation with the Metropolis Algorithm to simulate the lattice. 
Credit to David Bellanger and Barber for their implimentation of the algorithm.
